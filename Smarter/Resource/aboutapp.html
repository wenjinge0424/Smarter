    About the App
</div>
<p>
Smarter is an app that integrates education and technology. In a world
where social media, online gaming and cellphones have become an
overwhelming distraction. Smarter allows you to put education first.
Smarter allows parents to intermittently interrupt their children's device
usage with academic age appropriate questionnaire. Teachers can connect
with students and parents, by allowing their students to follow them on
smarter and adding study guide questions, that are relevant to the
curriculum they are using that day. Teachers have the option to sell these
guides through smarter to either other teachers or parents and students.
Parents, students and teachers will have access to the results, allowing
everyone to have a clear understanding of their progress. Smarter is about
putting education first.
